## Hi there, I'm Maariyaah!

I grew up in Lisbon, Portugal and moved to the UK 10 years ago where I  began my career in the insurance world in London. After achieving my goal of becoming a chartered insurance professional, I decided to pivoted towards the world of tech! I  completed Le Wagon's Web Development bootcamp with the drive to pursue a new career. I am now committed to leveraging this new skill set alongside my enthusiasm and curiosity to bring innovation to a new industry!
